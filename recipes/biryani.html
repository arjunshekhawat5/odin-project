    <h3>Steps to make Chicken Biryani</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare saffron-kewra water and chop veggies
        <p>
          To make a delightful chicken biryani dish, firstly soak saffron in
          water to prepare saffron water (one tsp saffron can be soaked in 1/4
          cup water). Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make kewra
          water. Set them aside for later usage. Now, chop the onion and
          coriander leaves and keep them aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Saute the onions
        <p>
          Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the oil is hot
          enough, add cumin seeds, bay leaf, green cardamom, black cardamom,
          cloves in it, and saute for about a minute. Then, add chopped onion to
          it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it with slit green
          chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger-garlic paste, red chilli
          powder and green chilli paste. Mix well all the spices and cook for
          2-3 minutes. Then, add hung curd into it and give a mix. (Make sure
          the chicken is washed properly and patted dry before adding it to the
          dish)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook biryani on low heat for 5-6 minutes
        <p>
          Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with
          ginger julienned, coriander and mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose
          water and 1 tsp saffron water in it. Cook till the chicken is tender.
          Then add 1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly. Then add the remaining
          saffron water and pour ghee over it. You can now cook the dish without
          the lid or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due to the steam
          formation.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve hot chicken biryani with your favourite chutney or raita
        <p>
          Cook for 15-20 minutes with a closed lid and garnish with 1 tbsp fried
          onions and coriander leaves. Serve hot chicken biryani with raita of
          your choice. Enjoy!

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The first and foremost important thing to take care of while preparing
        chicken biryani recipe is, always use a heavy-bottomed pan as you would
        not want the chicken getting cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        The restaurant-style chicken biryani recipe uses the whole chicken in
        preparation and the chicken can dry when cooking at home. Always use
        chicken thigh or drumsticks.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want your chicken to be juicier in your biryani, do not remove
        the bone.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your cooked rice has turned sticky, spread it on a plate and leave it
        for 5 minutes. The rice will be separate and fluffy again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Freshly pound spices bring out the best taste in Chicken Biryani Recipe,
        so make sure that you dry roast all the whole spices for a good 2-3
        minutes and then pound or grind them.
